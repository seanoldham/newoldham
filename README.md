## NewOldham

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/seanosaur/newoldham.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/seanosaur/newoldham)

We're getting married! Instead of building a site through a service, we decided to build our own. After the wedding, we hope to use this as a blog to update everyone on life stuff. House, kids, that kind of thing.

I've been learning web development and Rails and it's always fun to have new projects. I make a point to learn something new with every project. For this one, I plan to learn testing and how to properly use a CI. Hopefully it goes well!

The site will be hosted at [newoldham.com](http://newoldham.com).
